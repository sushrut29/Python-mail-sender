# Python-mail-sender
This is a Python script to send emails through Python. It not only sends a text message but also facilitates attaching files to the mail.
To use this script, you need to enable "less secure apps" setting in the gmail account through which you are sending the email.
For that purpose, the link is here - https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
